# RISS-IMU-Mechanization

An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) used in Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) contains three accelerometers and three gyroscopes (sensors) mounted orthogonal to each other, aligned with the body axis (body frame). The process of mechanization involves integrating the sensor outputs to obtain the user states (position, velocity, attitudes). This project discusses the process of mechanizing with reduced inertial sensor system (RISS) to obtain 3-Dimensional (3D) position, for a land vehicular movement, where the vehicles move mostly in horizontal plane
